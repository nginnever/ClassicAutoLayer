A button that will ask all users of the addon to invite for an auto layering mechanism... layering is bad for the game wow

How to use:

Install
1. Download ZIP file at https://github.com/nginnever/ClassicAutoLayer
2. Extract folder to wow/classic/AddOns
3. Rename folder from ClassicAutoLayer-master to ClassicAutoLayer removing the -master
4. Restart Wow quickly (remember you have a 5 minute window to avoid queues)
5. Enable the ClassicAutoLayer addon
6. join the whisper channel /join autolayer in chat and you should be ready to click the layer button
7. Right click General tab on chat window, go to settings, then Global Channels and uncheck the channel autolayer if you want to remove the layer messages from showing up.
